# MERN Learning journey
I am parveen A, and I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Achariya College of Engineering.
## Objective
The objective of this course is to learn MERN Stack full-stack web development. This course helps me understand both frontend and backend technologies. By learning MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, I can develop dynamic, responsive, and secure web applications. This course also improves my coding skills and prepares me for real-world software development.
## Stack Overview (MERN Stack)
MERN Stack is a combination of four JavaScript-based technologies used for full-stack web development.
** MongoDB is used to store application data in database form. **
** Express.js is used to create backend APIs and handle server logic. **
** React.js is used to design interactive user interfaces. **
** Node.js is used to run JavaScript on the server side. **
Together, these technologies help in building fast and scalable web applications.
## Day-wise Content – Brief Explanation
Day 1 – Web & MERN Overview 
On Day 1, I learned the basics of web development and how websites work.
I studied the client–server architecture and the role of frontend and backend.
The introduction to MERN stack was explained.
I understood how MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js work together.
This day helped me get an overall idea of full-stack web development.
